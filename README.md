# cs32-final-project-AKFCMD
CS32 Final Project for Aidan Kennedy, Melchior Delloye, Freddie Coffey; A website for music lovers to find recommendations for the perfect song for any occasion.

#What it will be:
A website for music lovers (like us!) who can use our engine to discover great songs that fit their preferences. For example, they can retrieve a song based on them liking other songs or an artist, a songtime, a genre, etc, judging song popularity based on cumulative listening time and other factors. Furthermore, to add a social element, users can converse. In this vain, they can each take surveys, and then they can return a combined song recommendation for both of them (they can weight it toward the preferences of one user or the other too). 

#Computational Subtask
A Web-based engine which creates recommendation based on user's music preferences as inputs.
